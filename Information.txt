Time complexity
Recursive: O(n^2) 
Iterative: O(n^2) 
Worst case: 
Go through entire matrix - n^2
O(edges+vertices)
DFS (Depth First Search)

Memory complexity
Recursive: O(n^2)
Iterative: O(n^2)
Worst case: 
O(h) - h is height of the tree
DFS (Depth First Search)

Multi recursive method used. Time and memory complexity can be optimized by using a binary, linear, tail recursive solution.

Stack because of easier implementation (LIFO) and more comfortable. Use DFS so stack, queue is used for BFS.

Default statement is to return false, which is reached only when the board is unsolvable.
